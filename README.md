### ATM software project in OAMK (University of applied sciences, Information technology, first year </br>
We made a fullstack ATM that uses **RFID card reader** to log in to the ATM.</br>
The frontend was done with Qt Creator utilizing DLL's with signals and the backend was done with MySQL and RESTAPI </br>

**The DLL's we used in the project:** </br>
-RestApiDLL</br>
-PinUIDLL</br>
-RFIDDLL</br>
